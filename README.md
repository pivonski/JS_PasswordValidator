PasswordValidator
! ONLY DESKTOP VERSION !
live: https://password-validator.netlify.app/

A simple form created during learning JavaScript. 
It is a password validator that checks if the entered password is a strong enough security measure. 
The validator checks if the password contains:
- letters, 
- numbers,
- correct number of letters (in this case, 10),  
- special character. 
The changes are made by operating functional buttons on the page.
